BiKeTrack is and android app made for an university project on mobile programming.

The app allows the user to track his bicycle rides using the smartphone GPS and later check the gathered data and some useful statistics for a bicycle rider such as:
- Ride length and duration
- Average speed
- Minimum altitude
- Maximum altitude
- Wattage (estimate)

The data is saved on a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database). The app also uses the authentication capabilities of the Firebase platform, in this way the user can access his data from every supported device.

# Run

At the moment the app can be run by importing the project on Android Studio, setting up a Firebase project and getting a Google Maps API Key.
